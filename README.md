First repo! This is an old project I made that I wanted to add as my first repo on GitHub. Not sure if I did this the right way... 
Regardless, this is a four in a row game coded in WinForm .net Framework, with a few options to play: player v player, bot v player, and bot v bot (: .
The bot is "half smart"; if the bot can win, it will, and if it can prevent the opponent from winning it will do so. The rest of the bot's moves are almost "random."
It's very possible and quite easy to make the bot a little smarter... 
thank you,
